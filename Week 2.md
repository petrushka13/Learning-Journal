Learning Activities and Resources:
This week I created a simplest website on Joomla. I'm hosting it via cloudaccess.net.

Estimated Hours:
I have spent about 3 hours on courses and practicals. Assignment not included.

Content Insights:
CloudAccess became a good platform to host a joomla website however it works for 30 days only so I need to look for an alternative soon.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
After completing a practical I started to look for some resources on internet about CMS websites and found out that there are more easier ways to to host a website. From those findings I can conclude that there are more effective ways to build/host a website.
