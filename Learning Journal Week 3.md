Learning Journal Week 3 

Learning Activities: 

This week I have created a website using Wordpress and hosted it via CloudAccess. I have used some tips from LinkedIn course.

Estimated Hours:

I have spent only 2 hours on learning and practicals this week since I had other assignments.

Content Insights: 

I feel like I'm more interested using WordPress than Joomla. Joomla seems too complicated for me and boring sometimes while WordPress feels like a website contructing tool. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

I'm quite experienced with Web Development and had built many websites but didn't deploy most of them so for me WordPress seems like a future for a Web Dev industry. The only drawback of WordPress is that it should have more options regarding tools. It is understandable that they are trying to make the technology as simple as possible but it would be better if they added a Professional Version where the experienced user could do more.
